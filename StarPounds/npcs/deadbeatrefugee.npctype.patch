    "Oh hi there! We are looking for a new planet to settle on because our homeworld is a little bit too hot these days. Do you happen to know any good planets?",
    "I don't want to talk with anybody on this ship. They didn't allow me to take my pet Fennix with us, and I'm still sad about it.",
    "Not gonna lie, I don't even know how our ship was able to take off. Not that I care, though, I'm just glad that we're finally far away from burnt wastelands.",
    "I found a spider web in a corner yesterday. Never knew spiders can survive in low-gravity environments. But I know that I need a flamethrower now.",
    "Why is everyone calling us deadbeats? I mean, yeah, we can be lazy sometimes, but at least we put enough effort into building this shuttle.",
    "Oh hey, a guest from space! Sorry, we have no tea left for you. Nor cookies. In fact, we're running out of food and this is very, very bad.",
    "I'm blue da ba dee da ba die... Oh sorry, didn't see you approaching.",
    "It's too cold! I wouldn't mind a cup of hot chocolate. And a pie. And sweet cookies, too... Okay, great, now I'm cold and hungry.",
    "Judging by that matter thingy in your hand, you're one of those Protectorate dudes, right? Do you provide any aid to refugees? We definitely could use some.",
    "Guys, I'm telling you, we need to turn back! I forgot to turn off my oven before we left!"
